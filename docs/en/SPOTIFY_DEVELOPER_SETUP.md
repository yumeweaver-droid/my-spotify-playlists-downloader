# Setting up your Spotify Developer Account

## Why is a Spotify Developer Account needed?

This script uses Spotify’s Web API to retrieve your playlists.  
To use the API, you must authenticate via OAuth, which requires:

- A **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Spotify Developer Dashboard.
- A registered **Redirect URI** to complete the authentication flow securely.

> **Note:** Your Spotify Developer account can be the same as your existing Spotify user account. Creating a developer
> account does NOT affect your current playlists or music usage.
